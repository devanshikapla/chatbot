A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. It's a type of conversational agent that uses natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and respond to user inputs in a human-like way. Chatbots can be integrated into messaging platforms, websites, mobile apps, and other digital channels.

OpenAI, colors, readline-sync, and dotenv have been used to create a chatbot.

OpenAI: Utilized for advanced natural language processing, enabling the chatbot to understand and generate human-like responses.

Colors: Employed for incorporating colored text or styling in the console output, enhancing the visual presentation of the chatbot.

readline-sync: Implemented for synchronous reading of user input in the console, facilitating interactive communication with the chatbot.

dotenv: Used for loading environment variables, enhancing security, and managing configuration settings within the chatbot application.
